# AI-driven-domain-specific-ChatBot
Text-Summarization and Document-Based Question Answering System with OpenAI's GPT-3 using LangChain.

## Description
This project proposes an easy-to-implement approach for building an AI-driven, domain-specific chatbot research assistant that allows researchers to interact with their data and addresses the 'black-box cycle' and 'hallucination effect' observed in general-purpose large language models (LLMs).

### Dataset
The datasets used in this project are:
1. ‘Big Data Applications in Industry 4.0,’ edited by P. Kaliraj and T. Devi (PDF). You can download it [here.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357259970_Big_Data_Applications_in_Industry_40)
2. An article on Simplilearn’s website titled ‘14 Big Data Examples & Applications Across Industries’ (URL). You can view it [here.](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/big-data-tutorial/big-data-applications)

### Objective
Develop an AI-powered, specialized chatbot research assistant, enabling seamless interactions between researchers and their data.
